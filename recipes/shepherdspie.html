    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In England, the birthplace of this hearty dish, shepherd's pie is most often made with a ground lamb filling. In the States, it's more common to use ground beef. Both are delicious, and lamb can easily be subbed into this recipe following the same instructions.</p>

    </uo>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Make mashed potatoes: In a large pot, cover potatoes with water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until totally soft, 16 to 18 minutes. Drain and return to pot. </li>
        <li>Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until smooth. Add melted butter, milk, and sour cream. Mash together until fully incorporated, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make beef mixture: In a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme and cook until fragrant and softened, 5 minutes. Add ground beef, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook until no longer pink, 5 minutes more. Drain fat. </li>
        <li>Stir in frozen peas and corn and cook until warmed through, 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle meat with flour and stir to evenly distribute. Cook 1 minute more and add chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and let mixture thicken slightly, 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top beef mixture with an even layer of mashed potatoes and bake until there is very little liquid visible and mashed potatoes are golden, about 20 minutes. Broil if desired.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
