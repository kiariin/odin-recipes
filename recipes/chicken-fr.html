    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Fricassée is a traditional French chicken stew made with browned chicken pieces braised in a creamy 
        white mushroom sauce. A rustic family-style meal that's easy enough for midweek, it's a bit like a white 
        sauce version of Coq au Vin — except it's so much faster to make!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <uo>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken thighs and legs, combined</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, cut in large pieces</li>
        <li>3-4 springs thyme (leaves only)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    </uo>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Pat dry chicken with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Place a large deep pan over medium/high heat with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Brown chicken approximately 4 minutes per side until golden on each side but not cooked through. Remove to a plate and set aside until needed. Discard excess fat leaving 1 Tbsp in the pan. </li>
        <li>Add 1 Tbsp butter to the pan and saute chopped onions and carrots over low heat for 7-10 minutes. Add minced garlic and fresh thyme leaves and cook briefly for 30 seconds. Add 2 Tbsp flour and cook while stirring until flour is completely absorbed by the fat and mixture smells nutty. Add 1/2 cup white wine and simmer until slightly reduced. Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the pan together with the juices and bake uncovered at 350˚F for 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the oven and add 1/2 cup heavy cream, stir until combined. Taste and season with salt if needed.</li>
    </ol>
